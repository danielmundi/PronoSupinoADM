# Abstract

FINIMUNDI, D. S. **Feasibility analysis of algorithm for 3D kinematic evaluation of elbow pronation and supination.** 2016. 72p. Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso - Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo, São Carlos, 2016.

The main goal for this work is to provide a study for an open source alternative method for measuring the forearm’s axial rotation, since current methods are either primitives, like the universal goniometer, or too expensive and complex, like imaging processing software.The proposal is the implementation of an open source algorithm for data processing of an optic motion capture system, based on current literature and established patterns. In order to test this algorithm, a kinematics evaluation room was used to perform experiments in a volunteer, with help from a physiotherapist. The results had a high level of consistency, with maximum variation of 2° between the tests. However, the errors in comparison with a goniometer were as high as 7°. Thereby, it was shown that it is feasible to perform measurements with this system, although more test are needed in order to correct these errors and validate the algorithm.
